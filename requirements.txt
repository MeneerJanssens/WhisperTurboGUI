# Notes:
# - `ffmpeg` (the CLI) is required by the audio loader used by whisper; install it separately for your OS.
# - `ffmpeg-python` was not present in the current environment, so it is left unpinned here.
# - If you prefer a fully pinned list for the entire environment, run:
#
#   pip freeze > requirements.txt
#
#   and then review the file. On Windows, pinned torch wheels may include a build tag
#   (e.g. +cu118) that requires the same CUDA setup on the target machine.
